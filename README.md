Documentations on my paper Two Years after Connection: An Electricity Consumption Assessment of Households Connected under India′s Saubhagya
Scheme in Jharkhand

Abstract
India′s electrification schemes have been successful in connecting households to the grid. Still, the behavior of electricity users, especially those that have been recently connected is unclear. The failure of some consumers to pay for electricity burdens on utilities. In this paper, we analyze potential approaches to reduce the financial losses of utilities and economize the electrification process. Using the Jharkhand Energy Access Survey data, we show that Jharkhand′s utilities lost USD 7.53 million (95% confidence interval: 7.07-8.01) per month in 2019 due to unrecovered payments, almost the same as the billed amount collected. In fact, the ratio of not paying for electricity could be as high as 72 percent among people who have been connected to the grid under the free connection Saubhagya scheme in Jharkhand since 2017. The results show that a large proportion of nonpayment among newly connected groups is due to inefficient billing. Based on our results, more regular billing and official agents could help increase the payment compliance ratio. Our analysis suggests that cross-subsidizing the tariff paid by Saubhagya users could potentially reduce financial losses while maintaining revenue levels. We also discuss the potential of solar home systems in servicing remote households. We find that 90 percent of the demand of unelectrified households can be met by using 350 W solar panels without sacrificing cost-efficiency.
